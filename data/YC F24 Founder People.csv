My profile highlights scientific and technical competencies I have accumulated in Braintech and AI over the last seven years as a researcher. As an academic, I received several prestigious awards to self-fund my research which resulted in three first-author scientific publications in those subjects, with more manuscripts in progress, and a provisional patent submitted. 

I have become a versatile communicator, leader, and problem-solver, who loves to learn new skills. BJJ hobbyist, competitive chess player (former), and recreational soccer player.

At Dance, I worked on all aspects of our product: from consumer web products to internal tooling for our operations team. My work ranges from hands-on programming efforts to working closely with other leaders on long term planning and analysis. 

At Zalando, I led multiple teams in the Client Engineering group working on Zalandoâs GraphQL API, media delivery, backed-driven native mobile UIs, core web frameworks, and tracking.

At SoundCloud, I led the Core Listener Experience group (20+ people) which include the Player, Media Streaming, and Core Listener teams.

The Player and Media Streaming teams handle petabytes of data, gigabytes per second of traffic, and strive to provide a blazing fast playback experience to our users.

The Core Listener team is responsible for core mobile and web features like the Library, and Offline Sync.

I am a passionate individual who strives to learn through in hand experiences, hence in my pursuit of spreading my scope of knowledge in my early career, I have interned at various roles.

Currently being summer associate at PwC in Operations department, I am striving to develop my technical knowledge of vast operations in large scale industries and the process of optimizing the same using technology tools. Earlier I was interning with Reserve Bank of India in a finance and policy analysis role which was based on implementation of IBC on financial service providers. Before this I worked as an Intern at Ernst & Young in a sustainable strategy development role to reach India's COP 2030 goals. I have also worked with a social media startup called Slick! in the founder's office, which gave me a great experience of building growth strategies from scratch.

One of my peak experience involves serving Mood Indigo (the college cultural festival of IIT bombay) for two years, first as Concert's head to curate internationally renowned concerts, and thereafter as the Overall Coordinator where I carried the responsibility of overseeing every aspect of the fest while implementing widespread improvements.
