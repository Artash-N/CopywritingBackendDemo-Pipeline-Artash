Edward Aryee,"Hey Edward! Your journey from Google to founding SRE.ai is fascinating - especially your focus on dev tools and infrastructure. As another founder in the B2B tech space, I'd love to connect and hear about your YC experience so far (congrats on F24 btw!). I'm also in SF if you're up for grabbing coffee.","Thank you for accepting my connection! I know you're busy building something exciting at SRE.ai (congrats on YC F24 btw!).

Given your experience leading engineering teams at Google and Microsoft, I imagine you've seen firsthand how much time gets eaten up by repetitive outreach and follow-ups. That's actually what led me to build Pipeline - we help engineering and product leaders automate their LinkedIn outreach while keeping it personal and authentic.

Your background in IoT and building scalable systems at StratIS IoT and BuLogics really resonates with what we're doing. We've built automation that helps find and engage with the right people while maintaining that human touch. Plus, everything syncs directly with your existing CRM to keep data clean and current.

Would love to show you how other technical founders are using Pipeline to grow while staying focused on product and engineering. Happy to jump on a quick call next week if you're interested in learning more. If not, no worries at all - still great to connect!

Let me know what works best for you.

Best,
Sudarshan"
Victor Cheng,"Hey Victor! Really cool to see another YC founder working on AI solutions. Currently helping B2B startups scale their outreach at Pipeline, and your work with vly.ai caught my eye (YC F24, congrats!). Would love to connect and hear more about your entrepreneurial path from Quantum Labs to now.","Here's a natural follow-up message:

Hi Victor!

Thanks for connecting! Saw you're building vly.ai and just got into YC F24 (congrats on that btw!). As someone who's worked extensively with early-stage startups, I know firsthand how crucial efficient customer outreach can be during the early days.

I noticed your background includes both technical roles (like at Autodesk) and entrepreneurial ventures. What I find interesting is how many founders, especially those with strong technical backgrounds, often struggle with the sales and outreach piece while building great products.

We've built Pipeline specifically to help founders like yourself automate the tedious parts of LinkedIn outreach so you can focus more on building vly.ai. It handles everything from finding the right prospects to managing follow-ups, all while keeping your CRM updated automatically.

Would love to learn more about your current outreach strategy for vly.ai and share how other YC founders are handling this challenge. Are you free for a quick chat this week? Happy to share some insights that might be helpful as you scale.

Best,
Sudarshan"

Hey Arvind! Thanks for connecting. Congrats on getting into YC F24 with Fresco - that's huge!
