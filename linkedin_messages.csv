Edward Aryee,"Hi Edward! As a fellow YC founder, I love seeing other builders tackling B2B automation. Your background at Google and Microsoft, plus your work on SRE.ai caught my eye. Would love to connect and hear more about your journey building in the AI space - especially given your experience with scaled systems.","Hey Edward! Thanks for connecting. Love seeing another Bay Area founder who's also worked at some incredible tech companies (Google and Microsoft - quite the resume!).

I noticed we're both focused on making tech teams more efficient - you with SRE.ai and me with sales automation. Having worked with several early-stage startups, I've seen how much time technical teams spend on repetitive tasks instead of core innovation.

We've built Pipeline to help teams automate their LinkedIn outreach and keep their CRM data fresh without the manual work. Since you're building in the SRE space, I thought you might find it interesting - especially as you scale your YC company. Would love to learn more about your automation challenges at SRE.ai and share how other YC founders have streamlined their outreach.

Want to hop on a quick call next week? Happy to share some specific examples of how other technical founders are using automation to grow while staying focused on product development.

Best,
Sudarshan

We've been helping B2B startups streamline their outbound processes at Pipeline, particularly around LinkedIn engagement and CRM automation. Since you're in the AI space and likely thinking about scaling your own outreach soon, I'd love to share how we're approaching this challenge - might be some interesting parallels with what you're building at vly.ai.
