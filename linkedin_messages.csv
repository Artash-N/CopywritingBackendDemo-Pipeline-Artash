Having worked with early-stage B2B companies, I'd love to hear more about what you're building. Always enjoy connecting with fellow tech entrepreneurs in the bay!","Hey Edward! Really enjoy following your journey with SRE.ai - getting into YC F24 is huge. Saw your background at Google and Microsoft, particularly interested in your SRE work there. I run Pipeline, where we help B2B startups build and manage their outbound sales processes - something I thought might be relevant given you're now in founder mode at SRE.ai. Would love to learn more about your experience switching from big tech to startup life and share some insights on building early-stage sales motions. Have time for a quick call next week?"

Your robotics experience with FRC Team 2976 sounds pretty cool too.","Hey Victor - thanks for connecting! Been following your progress with vly.ai's YC batch. Your work on automating video personalization caught my attention, particularly given my background in B2B automation.

Up for a quick call next week to compare notes on automation and scaling? I'm pretty flexible on timing."
