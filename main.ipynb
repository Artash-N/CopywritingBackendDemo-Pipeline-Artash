Based on your experience at Goldman, you probably know how critical efficient outreach is. We've built a LinkedIn automation tool that's helping YC founders streamline their B2B sales - everything from finding leads to managing follow-ups. Given your fintech background, I'd love to get your take on some features we're developing specifically for that space. Free for a quick call this week to compare notes?</td>\n",
