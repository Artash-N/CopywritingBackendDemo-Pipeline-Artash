Given you're building Fresco and going through YC F24, I thought our sales automation tools could be helpful as you scale. We work with several YC companies to manage their outbound sales, helping them focus on product while we handle the prospecting and lead gen. Would love to share how other early-stage founders are using Pipeline to accelerate their growth. Free for a quick chat this week to explore if it makes sense for Fresco?</td>\n",

Your background in fintech at Goldman plus founding experience is super interesting. I run Pipeline - we help early B2B startups scale their outbound sales (especially YC companies).
