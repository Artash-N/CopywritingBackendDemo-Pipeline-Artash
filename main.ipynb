Your experience in both fintech and pharma is quite unique. Would love to connect and hear more about what you're working on.</td>\n",

As someone who's also building in the B2B space, I've seen how critical efficient sales outreach is for early-stage companies. We've developed some interesting automation tools at Pipeline that many YC founders are using to scale their outbound efforts while in build mode. Would love to show you what we've built and get your thoughts, especially given your background at Goldman. Any chance you have 15 mins next week for a quick chat?</td>\n",
